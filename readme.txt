	Dialog Editor v0.0

	1994,1995
	
	This is freeware. You can modify or use this code as you wish,
provided that my portion of the code reamins freeware (ie available 
to anyone, in listing form) and that you keep my notice at the beginning 
of each file.

	This program can be compiled with the following tools:
	
	emx 0.9a patchlevel 3
	dmake
	
	You'll need the PM++ class library. See the documentation of that
package for it's installation.

	To build the program, edit the makefile and set the CFLAGS and OS2CLASS
variables to point to the directory where the PM++ include and library files
are. (If you did'nt install the emx compiler in the /emx directory, you'll
have to edit also the other directory definitions at the beginning of the 
makefile). Then type:
	
	dmake
	

	Brief Description
	
	DlgEdit is a freeware dialog editor written with the PM++ class
library, to	show how the library works, and to show how a dialog editor
works. It is possible to create simple dialogs, and to create .rc
listings of the DIALOGTEMPLATEs. There is a modeless dialog which
can be used to view and modify the control list.
